# Final Project: Show What You’ve Learned!

Congratulations on making it to the final project! This is your chance to use everything you’ve learned so far to build something creative and unique. You have the freedom to choose what you want to make, as long as you apply the concepts and skills from this course.

## Project Guidelines

- **Be Creative:** Your project can be anything—a game, a tool, a manager app, a story, or something totally new!
- **Use Multiple Files:** Organize your code into logical files and folders (for example: separate files for classes, GUI, and data).
- **Multi-Page GUI:** Use Tkinter to create an application with multiple pages or screens.
- **Classes and Objects:** Use at least one class to manage your data or logic.
- **Data Persistence:** Save and load data using a `.txt` file or another method.
- **Custom Window:** Customize your window’s title, size, and icon. Add images or colors to make it your own.
- **User Interaction:** Include buttons, text boxes, or other widgets so users can interact with your app.
- **Error Handling:** Make sure your app handles invalid input or errors gracefully.
- **Documentation:** Comment your code and write a short description of your project in a README file.

## What to Turn In

- All your code files, organized in folders.
- A `README.md` that explains what your project does and how to use it.
- Any images, icons, or data files your app needs.
- An `.exe` version of your app if you want to share it with others.

## Tips

- Plan your project before you start coding.
- Start simple, then add features step by step.
- Test your app as you go.
- Ask for help if you get stuck—creativity is encouraged!

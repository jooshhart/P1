"""
Write a program that lets the user play a simple guessing game (like guessing a random number between 1 and 10).  
Each time the user wins, save their name and score to a file called `scoreboard.txt`.  
When the program starts, load and display the current scoreboard.
Use the `random` library for the guessing game.
Use functions for the main parts of your code.
Use file saving and loading as shown above.
Print the scoreboard in a nice format at the start and after each win.
Make sure your file path works with your folder structure!
Use comments to explain your code.
Test your code in the terminal.
Turn in your code by sending me the link.

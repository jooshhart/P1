"""
Make a program that lets the user roll different sided dice: d4, d6, d8, d10, and d20.
First you will need to import random.
Next you will need to find a way to make sure the user can only choose a dice of one of those sizes.
`random.randint` can be used to find a random number.
Make sure to make nice code that repeats and prints the answer in the end as a statement.
Use comments to explain your code.
Test your code in the terminal.
Turn in your code by sending me the link.

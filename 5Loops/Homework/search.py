"""
Create a search function that allows the user to search for a specific item in a list.
The list should contain at least 10 items.
Make an input variable so the user can put in the item they are searching for.
Use a boolean variable to keep track of whether the item was found or not.
Use a for loop to go through each item in the list.
Use an if statement to check if the current item matches the input variable.
If a match is found, set the boolean variable to True and break out of the loop.
Remember to print if the item was found or not after the loop.
Use comments to explain your code.
Test your code in the terminal.
Turn in your code by sending me the link.
